# not-really-virtual-env-nexus

Inspired when reading the book Nexus.

Although I knew too little of the history mentioned in this book, and also feel the author got too emotional and put too much of his sentiment when he introduced us to the social era, which spreads hatred rather than kindness(simply because the algorithms learned that negative news captured people's attention more)

### intersubjective reality

The gretest takeasy is that when I read about the *intersubjective reality*, the concept to summarize a lot of what I have heard and saw recently.

### virtual env made up of ilya, gpt, and the author Yuval Noah Harari, and versas the creativity coming from gpt itself.
It would be an interesting experiment.


some other random thoughts. ilya is more of a good software engineer first, then AI researcher, or the reverse?
