# not-really-virtual-env-nexus

Inspired when reading the book Nexus.

Although I knew too little of the history mentioned in this book, and also feel the author got too emotional and put too much of his sentiment when he introduced us to the social era, which spreads hatred rather than kindness(simply because the algorithms learned that negative news captured people's attention more),

the gretest takeway is the term *intersubjective reality* the author elaborated about, the concept to summarize a lot of what I have heard and seen recently.

Before this is made up inter-humnan:
- social status
- money
- fame
- social credit
These things are reality, cuz they affect us physically. But on the other hand, they are not what you actually need to survive as human being.

Now, the power of intersubejectivy reality has been handled to computer, possibly.
They would be able to, or, maybe already created inter computer reality.

### virtual env made up of ilya, gpt, and the author Yuval Noah Harari, and versas the creativity coming from gpt itself.
It would be an interesting experiment.


some other random thoughts. ilya is more of a good software engineer first, then AI researcher, or the reverse?
